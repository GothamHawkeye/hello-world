My first repo
My GitHub username is GothamHawkeye, which alludes to New York City, my residence ("Gotham" being a nickname for New York City since at least 1807 when Washington Irving used the term in his periodical *Salmagundi*), and Iowa, where I was born and raised ("Hawkeye" being a term for an Iowan).
